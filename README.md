[metalu.net](http://metalu.net) is a collective of artists and technicians pluridisciplinary, a place dedicated to the experimentation of new technologies in art, and a platform of resources serving digital artists.

[metalu.net](http://metalu.net) tries, as much as possible, to publish each tool or project that has been part of its activities; for two main reasons:

- we think that sharing the knowledge is the key, that's why we focus on the use of free and open-source tools; so it seems logical to make all tools we had to build accessible to all (and maybe somebody will help us to fix some bug, or to add a new functionality).
- it's the simplest way for us to have the most recent version of our work available at any time!

For readability we have separated common purpose tools from particular projects (e.g artistic works, or works resulting from a participative workshop):

- [metalu.net github repositories](https://github.com/MetaluNet) host libraries or documentation that could be directly useful for other people. 
- [metalunet-projects github repositories](https://github.com/MetaluNetProjects) is the memory of our activity. Anybody can have a look to these projects, which can help to know how we usually manage such projects.
